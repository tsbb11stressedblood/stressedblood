Depending greatly on the type and quality of the images which is processed through the program, the results from vary. Through a cross validation of the classifier, the classifier displays a result of 98%. If a stitched artificial image is processed the program give an accuracy of 95% correctly classified cells.  However, if a set of unmanipulated images is processed, the accuracy is 64%. 
The main issue with this task is to segment out folded and overlapping cells and find features for cell which vary greatly in morphology. These obstacles should be investigated further to increase the accuracy of the program.
